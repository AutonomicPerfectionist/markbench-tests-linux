# Procedure - F1 '22 Tests

F1 2022 (F1 '22) is installed via Steam, and considered automated for runs via Markbench. Game settings must be changed in-game prior to a scheduled run in Markbench, and the game exited prior to setting up Markbench.

In Steam, make sure that the In-Game overlay is disabled by going to Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In Game and toggling on the "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game" followed by toggling it off. There is currently a bug in Steam that it shows as off by default despite the overlay being enabled.

In Markbench, select the *F1\_22* test from the list on the left side of the Run Test(s) tab and ensure that the *Run* checkbox beside it is checked. Fill in the settings as follows:

- Project Slug should be the same as the Project Slug you are generating data for
- Test Parameter should be the same as the Test Parameter you are selecting to run, e.g. 'Games-1080', 'Games-1440', 'Games-2160' etc
- Scheduler Delay should be set to *5*
- Recording Delay &amp; Recording Timeout should be set to 0
- Repeat should be set to a minimum of *3* for a default run, unless changes are otherwise required
