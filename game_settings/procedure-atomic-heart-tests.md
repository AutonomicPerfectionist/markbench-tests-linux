# Procedure - Atomic Heart Tests

Atomic Heart is installed via Steam, and considered automated for runs via Markbench. Game settings must be changed in-game prior to a scheduled run in Markbench, and the game exited prior to setting up Markbench.

In Markbench, select the *Atomic Heart* test from the list on the left side of the Run Test(s) tab and ensure that the *Run* checkbox beside it is checked. Fill in the settings as follows:

- Project Slug should be the same as the Project Slug you are generating data for

- Scheduler Delay should be set to *5*
