# Procedure - Red Dead Redemption 2 Tests

Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is installed via Steam, and considered automated for runs via Markbench. Game settings must be changed in-game prior to a scheduled run in Markbench, and the game exited prior to setting up Markbench.

In Markbench, select the *Red Dead Redemption 2* Test from the list on the left side of the Run Test(s) tab and ensure that the *Run* checkbox beside it is checked. Fill in the settings as follows:

- Project Slug should be the same as the Project Slug you are generating data for
- Test Parameter should be the same as the Test Parameter you are selecting to run, e.g. 'Games-1080', 'Games-1440', 'Games-2160' etc
- Scheduler Delay should be set to *5*
- Recording Delay &amp; Recording Timeout should be set to 0
- Repeat should be set to a minimum of *3* for a default run, unless changes are otherwise required

## 1920x1080

### Games-1080

In-game, navigate to Settings &gt; Graphics.

#### Video

- Set Resolution to *1920x1080*
- Ensure Screen Type is set to *Fullscreen*
- Ensure Vsync is set to *Off*
- Ensure NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency is set to *Disabled*
- Ensure Triple Buffering is set to *On*

#### Graphics

- Using your keyboard's arrow keys, move up/down to highlight the Quality Preset Level setting, and tap the right arrow key until the bar is all the way to the right and the preset reads *Favor Quality*
    - This should ensure that all settings below it are correct, but RDR2 sometimes doesn't update them correctly (cause currently unknown). You can set them directly yourself, or hit the Restore Default button and start the process for this set of test parameters again from the beginning.

Apply changes using Enter, then to exit press Escape 3 times and Enter 1 time. Run tests via Markbench. Results should be uploaded via the Upload tab after all runs have completed successfully.
